# Gato GraphQL - Extension Starter

Gato GraphQL extensions add functionality and expand the GraphQL schema provided by [Gato GraphQL](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL).

**This template repository helps you kickstart a GitHub repo, to develop, test and release your own extensions for Gato GraphQL.**

To learn about the features provided by the multi-monorepo architecture on this starter project, jump to section [Multi-Monorepo (Architecture of the Extension Starter)](#multi-monorepo-architecture-of-the-extension-starter)

<details>

<summary>Trivia fact ðŸ¤”</summary>

_All extensions from [gatographql.com/extensions](https://gatographql.com/extensions/) (26 extensions and 4 bundles to date) are hosted on a monorepo created from `GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter` ðŸš€_

</details>

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1
- [Lando](https://lando.dev/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Recommended to use

- [XDebug](https://xdebug.org/) (integrated out of the box when using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Create your Extension Project

Follow these steps:

### Create your repo from this GitHub template

- Click on `Use this template` â†’ `Create a new repository`
- Select the GitHub owner, and choose a proper name for your repository (eg: `my-account/GatoGraphQLExtensionsForMyCompany`)
- Choose if to make it Public or Private
- Click on `Create repository`

As a result, a copy of this template will have been created under your GitHub repo:

![GitHub repo from template](assets/img/repo-from-template.png)

### Clone your repo locally

Clone your repository in your local drive using the `--recursive` option (needed to clone Git submodule `GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL`):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/my-account/GatoGraphQLExtensionsForMyCompany
```

### Install Composer dependencies

Run:

```bash
$ cd {project folder}
$ cd submodules/GatoGraphQL && composer install && cd ../.. && composer install
```

### Initialize the Project

This step will replace all the generic strings in the extension starter (the PHP namespace `MyCompanyForGatoGraphQL`, company name `My Company`, and others) with the values corresponding to your project.

Input your values in the command below and run:

```bash
composer initialize-project -- \
  --php-namespace-owner=MyCompanyName \
  --my-company-name="My Company Name" \
  --my-company-email=email@mycompany.com \
  --my-company-website=https://www.mycompany.com
```

These arguments (and additional ones, see below) are optional. If any of them is not provided, a default value is computed from the configuration in Git and the GitHub repo.

To see the default values, run:

```bash
composer initialize-project -- --dry-run
```

To print all the arguments for the `initialize-project` command, run:

```bash
composer initialize-project -- --help
```

<details>

<summary>View all <code>initialize-project</code> command arguments</summary>

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--git-base-branch` | Base branch of the GitHub repository where this project is hosted. If not provided, this value is retrieved using `git` |
| `--git-user-name` | Git user name, to "split" code and push it to a different repo when merging a PR. If not provided, this value is retrieved from the global `git` config |
| `--git-user-email` | Git user email, to "split" code and push it to a different repo when merging a PR. If not provided, this value is retrieved from the global `git` config |
| `--github-repo-owner` | Owner of the GitHub repository where this project is hosted (eg: "GatoGraphQL" in "https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter"). If not provided, this value is retrieved using `git` |
| `--github-repo-name` | Name of the GitHub repository where this project is hosted (eg: "ExtensionStarter" in "https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter"). If not provided, this value is retrieved using `git` |
| `--docs-git-base-branch` | Base branch of the (public) GitHub repository hosting the documentation for the extension, to access the images in PROD. If not provided, the value for option `git-base-branch` is used |
| `--docs-github-repo-owner` | Owner of the (public) GitHub repository hosting the documentation for the extension, to access the images in PROD. If not provided, the value for option `github-repo-owner` is used |
| `--docs-github-repo-name` | Name of the (public) GitHub repository hosting the documentation for the extension, to access the images in PROD. If not provided, the value for option `github-repo-name` is used |
| `--php-namespace-owner` | PHP namespace owner to use in the codebase (eg: "MyCompanyName"). If not provided, the value from the "github-repo-owner" option is used |
| `--composer-vendor` | Composer vendor to distribute the packages in the repo. If not provided, it is generated from the "php-namespace-owner" option |
| `--my-company-name` | Name of the person or company owning the extension. If not provided, the value for option `git-user-name` is used |
| `--my-company-email` | Email of the person or company owning the extension. If not provided, the value for option `git-user-email` is used |
| `--my-company-website` | Website of the person or company owning the extension. If not provided, the GitHub repo for this project is used |

</details>

### Review the License

The [license in the monorepo](LICENSE) is GPL v2.

If this this not your license, remove/replace this file.

### Commit, Push and Tag the Initial Project

Review the changes applied to the codebase on the step above. If any value is not correct (eg: if the PHP namespace should be a different one), you can undo all changes (`git reset --hard HEAD`), and run `composer initialize-project` again providing the right values.

Once all values are right, run:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Initialized project" && git push origin && git tag 0.0.0 && git push --tags
```

This will commit the codebase to your GitHub repo, and tag it with version `0.0.0`. (This tag is needed to start incrementing the version automatically from now on.)

## Run the webserver for DEV

A Lando webserver is set-up and configured to develop the extensions in the monorepo.

- Runs on PHP 8.1
- It directly uses the source code on the repo
- XDebug is enabled

Follow these steps:

### Build the Lando webserver for DEV

Run (only the first time):

```bash
composer build-server
```

After a few minutes, the website will be available under `https://gatographql-{composer-vendor}-extensions.lndo.site`.

(`{composer-vendor}` is an argument to the `initialize-project` command above; its default value is generated from the `php-namespace-owner` option.)

The URL is printed on the console under `APPSERVER URLS` (you will need to scroll up):

![Lando webserver URL](assets/img/lando-webserver-url.png)

To print the URL again, run:

```bash
composer server-info
```

_(This command also prints other useful data, including the port to connect to the MySql database, so you can visualize and edit the data in the DB using an external client, such as MySQLWorkbench.)_

<details>

<summary>What plugins are installed in the webserver? ðŸ¤”</summary>

All plugins hosted on the "upstream" monorepo:

- [Gato GraphQL](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql/gatographql.php)
- [Gato GraphQL - Testing](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/phpunit-plugins/gatographql-testing/gatographql-testing.php)
- [Gato GraphQL - Testing Schema](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/testing-schema/gatographql-testing-schema.php)

(The last two are utilities to run integration tests for Gato GraphQL. Among others, they provide CPT "dummy-cpt" and custom taxonomies "dummy-category" and "dummy-tag").

All plugins hosted on this "downstream" starter monorepo:

- [Gato GraphQL - Hello Dolly](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/blob/main/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/hello-dolly/gatographql-hello-dolly.php)

All the integration plugins, required by the extensions

- [Hello Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/)

Besides, some initial configuration is applied to the Gato GraphQL plugin Settings. For instance, the single endpoint is enabled (it is disabled by default).

</details>

### Log-in to the `wp-admin`

Credentials for `https://gatographql-{composer-vendor}-extensions.lndo.site/wp-admin/`:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

### Open the Gato GraphQL plugin in the `wp-admin`

Click on the Gato GraphQL link on the menu to open the GraphiQL client, and execute the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  helloDolly
}
```

(Field `Root.helloDolly` is provided via the extension plugin `gatographql-hello-dolly` hosted in this monorepo.)

If the installation of the starter was successful, you will receive a response:

!["Hello Dolly" in the webserver](assets/img/graphiql-hello-dolly.png)

### Run Integration Tests

Run:

``` bash
composer integration-test
```

### Start the Lando webserver for DEV

Building the webserver (above) is needed only the first time.

From then on, run:

```bash
composer init-server
```

## Run the webserver for PROD

A Lando webserver is set-up and configured to test the released extension plugins, generated by GitHub Actions.

- Runs on PHP 7.2
- You must download the generated plugins for PROD (from GitHub Actions) and install them on the webserver
- XDebug is not enabled

Follow these steps:

### Build the Lando webserver for PROD

Run (only the first time):

```bash
composer build-server-prod
```

After a few minutes, the website will be available under `https://gatographql-{composer-vendor}-extensions-for-prod.lndo.site`.

(The URL is the same one as for DEV above, plus appending `-for-prod` to the domain name.)

To print the URL again, run:

```bash
composer server-info-prod
```

The `wp-admin` login credentials are the same ones as for DEV.

### Start the Lando webserver for PROD

Building the webserver (above) is needed only the first time.

From then on, run:

```bash
composer init-server-prod
```

## Manage the Lando webservers

### Re-install the WordPress site (DEV and PROD)

You can at any moment re-install the WordPress site (and import the initial dataset).

On the DEV webserver:

```bash
composer reset-db
```

On PROD:

```bash
composer reset-db-prod
```

This is useful when:

- The installation when doing `build-server` was halted midway (or failed for some reason)
- Running the integration tests was not completed (modifying the DB data to a different state, so that running the tests again will fail)

### Re-build the Lando webserver for DEV

When a plugin or package folder has been renamed, you need to update the path in the `overrides` section of the [`.lando.upstream.yml`](webservers/gatographql-extensions/.lando.upstream.yml) Lando config file, and then rebuild the Lando webserver to reflect these changes.

Run:

```bash
composer rebuild-server
```

### Regenerate the Composer autoload files for DEV

When a new extension plugin is added to the monorepo, it must have its Composer autoload file generated, and the plugin must be symlinked to the Lando webserver.

Run:

```bash
composer rebuild-app-and-server
```

## Release your extension plugins for PROD

The monorepo includes scripts that completely automate the process of releasing the extension plugins in the monorepo.

Follow these steps:

### Tag the monorepo as `patch`, `minor` or `major`

Choose which version you will be releasing. The same version will be applied to all plugins in the monorepo.

_(Given that the current version is `0.0.0`...)_

To release version `0.0.1`, run:

```bash
composer release-patch
```

To release version `0.1.0`, run:

```bash
composer release-minor
```

To release version `1.0.0`, run:

```bash
composer release-major
```

<details>

<summary>What do these commands do? ðŸ¤”</summary>

Executing these commands will first prepare the repo for PROD:

- Update the version (in the plugin file's header, readme.txt's Stable tag, others) for all the extension plugins in the monorepo
- Update the documentation image URLs to point to that tag, under `raw.githubusercontent.com`
- Commit and push
- Git tag with the version, and push tag to GitHub

And then, it will prepare the repo for DEV again:

- Update the version to the next DEV version (next semver + `-dev`)
- Commit and push

</details>

To preview running the command without actually executing it, append `-- --dry-run`:

```bash
composer release-patch -- --dry-run
```

### Create release from tag in GitHub

After tagging the repo on the step above, we must create a release from the tag to generate the extension plugins for production.

To create the release, head over to the `tags` page in your GitHub repo (`https://github.com/my-account/GatoGraphQLExtensionsForMyCompany/tags`), and click on the new tag (eg: `0.1.0`).

Then, on the tag page, click on `Create release from tag`.

![Create release from tag](assets/img/create-release-from-tag.png)

This will trigger the [`generate_plugins.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/generate_plugins.yml) workflow, which will generate the extension plugins and attach them as assets to the tag page.

For instance, after tagging Gato GraphQL with `1.0.9`, the tag page [GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/1.0.9](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/releases/tag/1.0.9) had the following assets attached to it:

- `gatographql-1.0.9.zip`
- `gatographql-testing-1.0.9.zip`
- `gatographql-testing-schema-1.0.9.zip`

### Install the extension in the PROD webserver

Once the extension plugin has been generated, install it on the PROD webserver to test it, whether manually or using WP-CLI.

Using WP-CLI, if your repo is `my-account/GatoGraphQLExtensionsForMyCompany` and you have released version `0.1.0`, run:

```bash
$ cd webservers/gatographql-extensions-for-prod
$ lando wp plugin install https://github.com/my-account/GatoGraphQLExtensionsForMyCompany/releases/latest/download/gatographql-hello-dolly-0.1.0.zip --force --activate --path=/app/wordpress
$ cd ../..
```

### Query the extension in the `wp-admin`

Once you've installed the release on the Lando webserver for PROD, log-in to the `wp-admin`, access the GraphiQL client, and execute the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  helloDolly
}
```

If the release was generated successfully, you will receive a response:

!["Hello Dolly" in the webserver for PROD](assets/img/graphiql-hello-dolly-prod.png)

### Run Integration Tests for PROD

Run:

``` bash
composer integration-test-prod
```

## Creating your Extension Plugin

This starter project includes one fully-working extension plugin as demo: "Gato GraphQL - Hello Dolly", an integration for the [Hello Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/) plugin.

<details>

<summary>What does "Gato GraphQL - Hello Dolly" do? ðŸ¤”</summary>

This extension adds field `Root.helloDolly`, which returns any quote from the Hello Dolly song. The following query:

```graphql
{
  helloDolly
}
```

may return:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "helloDolly": "Dolly, never go away again"
  }
}
```

</details>

Describe the "Hello Dolly" demo

Search for "dolly" and "Dolly" in the codebase.

<details>

<summary>Browse the documentation within the codebase</summary>

The codebase contains snippets of documentation, to explain some feature or configuration.

Search for the following PHPDoc tags in the codebase:

- `@gatographql-project-info`: Information on some aspect of the monorepo setup
- `@gatographql-project-action-maybe-required`: Indicates if some feature can be enabled/disabled and how
- `@gatographql-extension-info`: Information on some aspect of the extension setup
- `@gatographql-example`: Provides an example from the upstream monorepo
- `@gatographql-readonly-code`: Indicates that the code must not be changed, as it is automatically modified via some script

</details>

Because of scoping!
	Indicate in instructions
	i.e. If the plugin needs 3rd-party libraries, these must be scoped
		So these must be referenced under hello-gato-schema

## Development Process

### Purging the cache

When developing an extension and testing it in the DEV webserver, whenever we create a new PHP service or modify the signature of an existing one (such as the PHP classname), we need to purge the container cache.

Run:

```bash
composer purge-cache
```

<details>

<summary>How does Gato GraphQL use a service container? ðŸ¤”</summary>

The Gato GraphQL plugin uses a service container (via the [Symfony DependencyInjection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html) library), to manage all services in PHP.

Services are PHP classes, and must be defined in configuration files `services.yaml` and `schema-services.yaml` to be injected into the container.

The first time the application is invoked, the container gathers all injected services and compiles them, generating a single PHP file that is loaded in the application.

Generating this file can take several seconds. To avoid waiting for this time on each request, the Gato GraphQL plugin caches this file after it has been generated the first time.

The container needs to be purged whenever a service is created, or an existing one updated or removed.

(In production, the Gato GraphQL plugin purges the cache whenever a new extension plugin is activated, or when the plugin Settings are updated. During development, it can in addition be triggered manually, by running `composer purge-cache`.)

This applies to resolvers (type resolvers, field resolvers, directive resolvers, and any other resolver that gives shape to the GraphQL schema), as these are PHP services. Whenever a resolver is added or removed, or is updated in such a way that modifies the GraphQL schema, the cached container must be purged.

Some example resolvers are:

- `String` type: [`StringScalarTypeResolver`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/1.0.0/layers/Engine/packages/component-model/src/TypeResolvers/ScalarType/StringScalarTypeResolver.php)
- Field `User.name` (and others): [`UserObjectTypeFieldResolver`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/1.0.0/layers/CMSSchema/packages/users/src/FieldResolvers/ObjectType/UserObjectTypeFieldResolver.php)
- `@skip` directive: [`SkipFieldDirectiveResolver`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/1.0.0/layers/Engine/packages/engine/src/DirectiveResolvers/SkipFieldDirectiveResolver.php)

</details>

### Regenerating the monorepo configuration

After adding a plugin or package to the monorepo, the configuration (containing all the packages) must be regenerated.

Run:

```bash
composer update-monorepo-config
```

<details>

<summary>What does command <code>update-monorepo-config</code> do? ðŸ¤”</summary>

The `update-monorepo-config` command will:

- Regenerate the root `composer.json`, adding the new packages
- Regenerate the root `phpstan.neon`, adding the new packages

</details>

## Development Tools

### Error logs

Access the error logs from the Lando webserver:

```bash
composer log-server-errors
```

For PROD:

```bash
composer log-server-errors-prod
```

### SSH

SSH into the Lando webserver:

```bash
composer ssh-server
```

For PROD:

```bash
composer ssh-server-prod
```

## Debugging

XDebug is already integrated when using VSCode.

Add a breakpoint in the source code and then, in the `Run and Debug` tab, press on `Start Debugging` with the corresponding configuration (defined in [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json)):

- `[Lando webserver] Listen for Xdebug`: For debugging the source code while running the Lando webserver for DEV
- `[PHPUnit] Listen for Xdebug`: For debugging PHPUnit tests

XDebug is enabled but inactive; it must be activated when requesting the webpage (see below).

### Debugging in the Lando webserver for DEV

Activate XDebug for a request by appending parameter `?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` to the URL (for any page on the Gato GraphQL plugin, including any page in the wp-admin, the GraphiQL or Interactive Schema public clients, or other).

For instance:

- `https://gatographql-{composer-vendor}-extensions.lndo.site/wp-admin/edit.php?page=gatographql&action=execute_query&XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1`
- `https://gatographql-{composer-vendor}-extensions.lndo.site/graphiql/?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1`

### Debugging PHPUnit tests

Activate XDebug by prepending `XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` before the `phpunit` command to run the unit tests.

For instance:

```bash
XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1 vendor/bin/phpunit submodules/GatoGraphQL/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/phpunit-packages/gatographql/tests/Unit/Faker/WPFakerFixtureQueryExecutionGraphQLServerTest.php
```

## Continuous Integration

### Executing Integration Tests against InstaWP

When a PR is merged, all extension plugins in the monorepo are generated for DEV, and attached to workflow [`generate_plugins.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/generate_plugins.yml) (in its Summary tab).

Then, workflow [`integration_tests.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/integration_tests.yml) is triggered. This workflow installs the generated plugins in an InstaWP instance, and executes the integration tests against this instance.

To use it, you need to:

- Expose the artifacts in your repo via [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/) (so these can be installed by InstaWP without being logged-in using a GitHub account)
- Have an account on [InstaWP](https://instawp.com/) with access to SSH + WP-CLI
- Prepare a template in InstaWP, and import the needed dataset to run the tests, via WP-CLI
- Provide the template slug and repo ID from InstaWP via file [`InstaWPConfigDataSource.php`](src/Config/Symplify/MonorepoBuilder/DataSources/InstaWPConfigDataSource.php)

To import the dataset, you must run the following bash scripts in your InstaWP instance:

- [setup/setup.sh](webservers/gatographql-extensions/setup/setup.sh)
- [setup-extensions/setup.sh](webservers/gatographql-extensions/setup-extensions/setup.sh)

### Disable unneeded workflows

Review the GitHub Actions workflows that you need for your project.

Most likely, the following GitHub Actions workflows are not initially needed:

- [`integration_tests.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/integration_tests.yml): You first need to have InstaWP and configure the template accordingly
- [`scoping_tests.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/scoping_tests.yml): Initially there are no packages to scope in the starter
- [`split_monorepo_tagged.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/split_monorepo_tagged.yml): The "Monorepo Split" is not enabled by default (see section [Monorepo Split](#monorepo-split) below)
- [`split_monorepo.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter/actions/workflows/split_monorepo.yml): Same as above

If this is the case, you can [disable these workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow) so they don't run unnecessarily.

## Multi-Monorepo (Architecture of the Extension Starter)

`GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter` is a [monorepo](https://css-tricks.com/from-a-single-repo-to-multi-repos-to-monorepo-to-multi-monorepo/#aa-stage-3-monorepo), containing the codebase for not only one, but multiple extension plugins for Gato GraphQL (and also their composing packages).

![Monorepo architecture](assets/img/monorepo.webp)

`GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter` is also a [multi-monorepo](https://css-tricks.com/from-a-single-repo-to-multi-repos-to-monorepo-to-multi-monorepo/#aa-stage-4-multi-monorepo), including the main Gato GraphQL plugin (hosted under the [`GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL) monorepo) as its upstream, via a Git submodule under `submodules/GatoGraphQL`.

![Multi-Monorepo architecture](assets/img/multi-monorepo.webp)

The monorepo is managed via the [Monorepo Builder](https://github.com/symplify/monorepo-builder).

The benefits of using the multi-monorepo approach as a starter project are several.

<details>

<summary>Do packages need to be published to Packagist? ðŸ¤”</summary>

No. The packages are internal, and the Monorepo Builder can symlink to the internal packages, hence these are not retrieved from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).

However, as an advanced use case, you do have the option to distribute packages via Packagist (or any other directory). For that, the "Monorepo Split" feature must be enabled (see section [Monorepo Split](#monorepo-split) below), and then you can link to the package on its own repo.

### Automation

There are scripts and workflows to automate (as much as possible) the whole process of creating an extension plugin, from developing it, to testing it, to releasing it.

As a consequence, you only need to concentrate on the actual code for your extension; you won't need to worry about tools and boilerplate for the project (saving you no little time and effort).

### Browse the Gato GraphQL source code

The source code of the Gato GraphQL plugin is always readily-available when developing our extensions, and it is kept up to date just by fetching the Git changes from the upstream repo.

This is important as documentation (mostly when we first start developing with Gato GraphQL) and for debugging (XDebug is integrated out of the box).

### Host the codebase for multiple extensions, and all their packages, all together

The repo contains the source code for not only one, but multiple extension plugins for Gato GraphQL, and also for all their packages.

By hosting all extensions and their packages together, you avoid [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

You are also able to do bulk modifications, such as searching and replacing a piece of code across different plugins, in a single action (and push it to the repo using a single commit).

### Continuously access newly-developed code

Once we create a new repository from a GitHub template, the repository and the template are two separate entities. From that moment on, when the template is updated, these changes are not reflected in the repository.

The Gato GraphQL monorepo deals with this issue by providing tools that copy content (code, scripts, workflows, etc) from the Gato GraphQL repo (available as a Git submodule) to the extension project repo. This enables the extension project to be updated when there are changes to the main plugin.

See section [Synchronizing files from the upstream Gato GraphQL repo](#synchronizing-files-from-the-upstream-gato-graphql-repo) to learn more.

### Use the GitHub Actions workflows developed for the Gato GraphQL plugin

The GitHub Actions workflows developed for the Gato GraphQL plugin are readily-available to create and release our extensions.

This includes Continuous Integration workflows to:

- Generate the plugin (when merging a PR, or creating a release from a tag)
- Scope the extension plugin
- Downgrade the code from PHP 8.1 (for DEV), to PHP 7.2 (for PROD)
- Run coding standard checks (via PHPCS), unit tests (via PHPUnit) and static code analysis (via PHPStan)
- Run integration tests via InstaWP (automatically installing the newly-generated extension plugin on the InstaWP instance)

### Downgrade Code - PHP 8.1 (during DEV) is converted to PHP 7.2 (for PROD)

The source code for the main Gato GraphQL plugin, and any of its extensions, is PHP 8.1.

For distribution, though, the plugin and extensions use PHP 7.2, thanks to a "downgrade" process of its code via [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/).

Downgrading code provides the best trade-off between availability of PHP features (during development), and the size of the potential userbase (when releasing the plugin):

- Use the strict typing features from PHP 8.1 (typed properties, union types, and others) to develop the plugin, reducing the possibility it will contain bugs
- Increase the potential number of users who can use your plugin, in production, by releasing it with PHP 7.2

_Not all PHP 8.1 features are available, but only those ones that are "downgradeable" via Rector. Check the list of [Supported PHP features in `GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/master/docs/supported-php-features.md)._

### Scope 3rd-party libraries

When the extension uses 3rd-party libraries (loaded via Composer), these must be "scoped" by prepending a custom PHP namespace on their source code. This is needed to prevent potential conflicts from other plugins installed in the same WordPress site referencing a different version of the same library.

[PHP-Scoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper) is already integrated in this monorepo (ready to be used whenever needed).

### Lando webservers are ready

Lando is already set-up and configured, making 2 webservers available:

1. A webserver to develop the extensions, using PHP 8.1
2. A webserver to test the generated extension plugins, using PHP 7.2

### The source code is mapped to Lando's DEV webserver

The Lando webserver for DEV (on PHP 8.1) overrides the code deployed within the container, mapping the source code from the repo instead.

As such, changes to the source code will be immediately reflected in the webserver.

### XDebug is already configured

XDebug is already integrated (when using VSCode), supporting:

- The extension's source code
- The main Gato GraphQL plugin's source code (accessible via the Git submodule)
- The WordPress core files

This allows you to add breakpoints in the code, and analyze the full stack trace to see how the code and logic works, anywhere.

### Documentation images in the extension are served from the repo

When generating the extension plugin, images to be displayed in the documentation are excluded from the `.zip` file (thus reducing its size), and referenced directly from the GitHub repo (under `raw.githubusercontent.com`).

### Monorepo Split

Even though the code for all plugins and packages is hosted all together in a monorepo, we can optionally also deploy their code to a separate GitHub repo of their own, via a "Monorepo Split". This happens automatically for all plugins and packages that were modified, when merging a PR.

This is useful for:

- Distributing packages via Composer
- Exploring source code outside of the monorepo

![Monorepo Split](assets/img/monorepo-split.webp)

The monorepo split feature is disabled by default. To enable it, return an empty array in method `getExtensionSkipMonorepoSplitPackagePaths` from class [`MonorepoSplitPackageDataSource`](src/Config/Symplify/MonorepoBuilder/DataSources/MonorepoSplitPackageDataSource.php).

### Distribute PROD code to its own repo

Similar to the monorepo split, when generating the plugin for PROD, we can deploy its code (scoped, downgraded, with the Composer autoload generated, etc) into its own repo.

This is useful for:

- Allowing users to create issues, pinpointing where a problem happens

## Multi-Monorepo Tools

### Synchronizing files from the upstream Gato GraphQL repo

Run:

```bash
composer copy-upstream-files
```

<details>

<summary>What files does <code>copy-upstream-files</code> copy? ðŸ¤”</summary>

Executing `composer copy-upstream-files` will copy files from the "upstream" `GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL` repo (which is a Git submodule), to the "downstream" `my-account/GatoGraphQLExtensionsForMyCompany` repo.

These files include GitHub Actions workflows and Lando config files.

For instance, the Lando webserver for DEV uses the source code files from the main Gato GraphQL plugin, via the mapping defined in the upstream file [`.lando.upstream.yml`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/blob/master/webservers/gatographql/.lando.upstream.yml).

Whenever that file is updated in the Gato GraphQL repo, by executing `composer copy-upstream-files` we will fetch that updated file and copy it as the downstream [`.lando.base.yml`](webservers/gatographql-extensions/.lando.base.yml) file (it is renamed in the process, and the paths are adapted to point to `submodules/GatoGraphQL/...`).

Then we execute `composer rebuild-server`, and the new mapping will take effect.
